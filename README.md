Grunt Structure for WP Theme Development
========================================

This is how I structure things for developing WP themes with grunt for image optimization, css preprocessing, and js concatenation.

========================================

Go get a wordpress theme scaffold from [Underscores.me](http://underscores.me/) and extract the files into this same structure.

Caveat
================================

I barely know what I am doing. I intend for this to be a personal starting point for my own projects. If you want to use it, then by all means go for it, but I can't guarantee anything.
